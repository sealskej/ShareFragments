ShareFragments
==============

Share simple data to other apps using Android Fragments

Info
----

On Android you can send simple data to other apps using [system dialog][1] (a "chooser") or by using [easy share action][2].
If you want to share data using Fragments, you have no ready to use way. That's purpose of this library.

I would like to encourage all Android developers to prefer full-screen to nasty dialogs. More explanation by Roman Nurik [here][3].
